## How to release

### Prerequisites

#### Setup Environment

You need to install
 - java
 - maven
 - cmake

#### Setup Maven
You need to setup the bintray username/password in your
local `~/.m2/settings.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0" 
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
	<server>
		<id>bintray</id>
		<username>raisercostin</username>
		<password>10d49f760982f6*as sample*e133a0dec77439</password>
	</server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

(!) You can find the password at https://bintray.com/profile/edit > API Key

### Releasing

(!) Building works only in osx/linux since the build is dependent on shell scripts and cmake.

1. Change the versions to the release one:
   
   ```
   mvn org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-versions-plugin:0.20.0:set-version -Dtycho.mode=maven -DnewVersion=2.2.1
   ```
   (!) The tycho-versions plugin handles the versions for eclipse too compared with *versions* plugin.

2. Deploy to bintray with profile *release* to generate and deploy javadoc and sources as well.
    
    ```
    mvn deploy -DskipTests -Prelease
    ```
    (!) For now the idea plugin is not generated since needs a intelij to be installed.

3. Publish manually in bintray if in pom.xml distributionManagement url is finished with publish=0.
    Change publish=1 to publish in bintray automatically.
    After publishing you can find the artifacts here: https://dl.bintray.com/raisercostin/maven/com/mobidevelop/robovm/
    If a request to add the project to jcenter is approved you can find them here: http://jcenter.bintray.com/com/mobidevelop/robovm/

4. Tag the release in git:
    
    ```
	git commit -am "Set release version 2.2.1"
	git tag robovm-2.2.1
	```

5. Prepare next development cycle
     ```
     mvn org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-versions-plugin:0.20.0:set-version -Dtycho.mode=maven -DnewVersion=2.2.2-SNAPSHOT
     git commit -am "Set next development version 2.2.2-SNAPSHOT"
	git push --tags
	```
